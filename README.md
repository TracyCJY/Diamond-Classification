# Diamond-Classification
## Background Information
Diamond is one of the most valued gem stones in the world. The quality of a diamond is often graded according to what is well-known as the 4Cs: Carat, Cut, Colour and Clarity. There are also other objective and physical attributes, especially those that relates to the dimensions of the diamond. You are asked by your company to build a classification engine to classify any diamond into three classes: Low, Mid and High, based on data accumulated of grading by experts over the years. The ML classification engine will be used by newly trained gem expert to assist them in their job.
## Dataset Information
The dataset consists of 10,000 diamonds over various characteristics, in .csv format and the following data dictionary:  
**carat:** weight of the diamond (1 carat = 0.2 g). 
**cut:** quality of the cut rated by experts (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).   
**colour:** rated from D (best) to J (worst) for our dataset   
**clarity:** a measure of how clear the diamond is as defined by GIA Clarity Chart ((I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best)â€“ see later.   
**length ,width:** the widest orthogonal dimensions looking from the top (also called x, y in mm. for round diamond, it is also called diameter and x = y)  
**height:** the height (also called depth z in mm) of the diamond   
**depth ratio:** depth percentage = height / mean (length, width) = 2 * z / (x + y) in %   
**table:** percentage of width of the top facet of the diamond to the width. 
## Requirements
1. Design and implement a ML model to classify any new diamond in the three categories (Low, Mid and High grade).
2. An account of what you have done in investigating and transforming your data and why.
3. Use Classification models you have learned so far to build a classification engine as specified.
4. Any observation you may have in your project to the management of the company.
